Research Paper: Enhancing Model Explainability Through S-GuISE: A Spectral Clustering-Guided Input Sampling Scheme

In this paper the contribution is to design new metrics - DTI and DTD metrics for XAI method evaluation
and novel XAI method S-GuISE for image related XAI method.

For state-of-the-art comparison: GuISE, Grad-CAM, LIME, RISE is utilized (Check their official implementation code of the paper)

GuISE Code link: https://github.com/aulphin/GuISE-XAI

Tutorial_Image_Classification_Keras.ipynb: LIME official code is executed, see their paper for detail

CAM_Metrics_And_Tuning_Tutorial.ipynb: GRAD-CAM publicly avail. code is executed, see their paper for detail

S-GuISE_demo.ipynb: Main code implementation with new evaluation metric

Rise_Demo.ipynb: Official RISE code experimented with new evaluation metric

Publicly Available: ImageNet and PASCAL-VOC dataset is utilized in this experiment
